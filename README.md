# Eloquent JavaScript stuff

**Description:** Exercises and other stuff related to *Eloquent JavaScript* by Marijn Haverbeke, for learning. Pretty good book. Lots of projects, exercises, and things to build on in there. This will grow as I do more exercises from this one. There is a lot of code from *Eloquent JavaScript* used in here with the permission of the book's author, and a good deal of my own code on top of that.

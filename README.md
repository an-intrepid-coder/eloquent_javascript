# Eloquent JavaScript stuff

**Description:** Exercises and other stuff related to *Eloquent JavaScript* by Marijn Haverbeke, for learning. Pretty good book. Lots of projects, exercises, and things to build on in there. This will grow as I do more exercises from this one (I haven't done a lot of it yet). There is a lot of code from *Eloquent JavaScript* used in here with the permission of the book's author, and a good deal of my own code on top of that.

**About the Projects:** Eloquent JavaScript is full of projects and also exercises which are good projects in their own right. At the moment I am focused on the exercise from the end of chapter 18, which asks the user to implement Conway's Game of Life. Takes on other projects and exercises will be expanded on later.

// TODO: Basically like Group.has(), but recursive. Probably very important for
//       writing JS stuff professionally in certain edge cases. Vital for
//       parsing arbitrary objects and JSON files probably.

    // TODO -> this one next I think. Good little project for tomorrow morning after a run.
}

// TODO: Apply this to Object.prototype by default on new Classes?

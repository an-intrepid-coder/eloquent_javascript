# TODO list for web-based Conway's Game of Life (in no particular order):

* Zoomable/Scaleable buttons
* Speed slider buttons

* Party toggle
* Stones toggle

* FINISH Glider Fleet: It should loop over #cells dynamically and randomly on/off each glider-size square of cells w/ buffer (so 5x5 cells per super-cell)

* color picker instead of calls to prompt() for BG/FG Color buttons
* Sliders for speed/scale instead of buttons
* Implement the optimization from Wikipedia that automatically skips cells it knows won't be updated.
* Dynamic initial canvas size based on user's screen
* click-and-drag toggling of multiple cells
* Set/Save seeds in localStorage
* Button for **fleets** of duelling gliders 
* user input # for duelling gliders.
* implement Iterable interface for LifeGrid)
* Back/Reverse functionality/buttons (how far back? to be determined)
* Use localStorage to preserve state on refresh/reload
* Some kind of unit testing. 
* Make into a proper web page using later book projects as a template
* A little more styling.
* auto-detect when the sim is at or close to its finished state (including checks for long-period oscillators)

# BUGS:

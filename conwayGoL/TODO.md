# TODO list for web-based Conway's Game of Life (in no particular order):

* FINISH Glider Fleet: It should loop over #cells dynamically and randomly on/off each glider-size square of cells w/ buffer (so 5x5 cells per super-cell)
* Dynamic initial canvas size based on user's screen
* Set/Save seeds in localStorage
* Play button
* lock manual toggle functionality behind a toggle switch for the user
* Button that lets user input # of gens to replace 10/100/1000 buttons
* Zoomable/Scaleable
* Speed slider and/or buttons
* Stones mode
* Party mode
* Button for **fleets** of duelling gliders 
* user input # for duelling gliders.
* Variable height/width
* implement Iterable interface for LifeGrid)
* Back/Reverse functionality/buttons (how far back? to be determined)
* Use localStorage to preserve state on refresh/reload
* Some kind of unit testing. 
* Make into a proper web page using later book projects as a template
* A little more styling.
* Allow user to change color of background and cells
* Buttons to control animation speed
* Implement the optimization from Wikipedia that automatically skips cells it knows won't be updated.
* auto-detect when the sim is at or close to its finished state (including checks for long-period oscillators)

# CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE 

**Description:** The exercise on page 330 of *Eloquent JavaScript* asks the user to make Conway's Game of Life using checkboxes. This is a neat exercise, and I chosen to make it a centerpiece project that ties together lessons from the book and go beyond the requirements of the exercise (for example, among many other things, it now uses the canvas instead of checkboxes for the cell grid). There are a lot of things I plan on doing with this one.

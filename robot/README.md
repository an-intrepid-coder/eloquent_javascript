# Robot Exercise

This one is lengthy but it is apparently a good template for persistent data structures in JS, which could be good to know. I am not going to follow along here, but I will make a note of good exercies to extract from the chapter for later use:

* randomIndex(array) with Math.Floor(Math.random() * array.length)
* I suppose one way to advance the exercise would be to follow along and then apply A-star and Dijkstra to the examples given. That's one for later.

# File Server

A file server I can use for local testing. It is based on the functions in Chapter 20 of *Eloquent JavaScript*, and is useful for trying to modularize other projects based on Eloquent JavaScript's exercises, since browsers will sometimes complain about the module system unless you're running the page on a server. The firefox logs point you to an MDN article recommending lots of options for getting around that, but you can also just use this example server from chapter 20.
